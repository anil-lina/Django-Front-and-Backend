<h3>Welcome to Part 8: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h3>
<p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the Spy to read!</p>
